* boot-runit

A boot task that will provision your Clojure program to be managed with the [[http://smarden.org/runit/][runit]] supervisor, typically on a production server.
If you’ve never used ~runit~ before, you may want to refer to Kevin Chard’s excellent [[http://kchard.github.io/runit-quickstart/][quickstart]]. I have curated some more links in a blog [[http://danielsz.github.io/2014/12/06/lein-runit/][post]]. Once you understand how things work, you may want to come back and use *lein-runit* to automate the workflow for Clojure projects.
** Installation

In ~build.boot~:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(set-env! :dependencies ‘[[danielsz/boot-runit "0.0.3"]])
(require '[danielsz.boot-runit :refer [runit]])
#+END_SRC

** Usage
